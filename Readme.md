# GCX Algorithm Benchmark Suite

This benchmark suite evaluates the **[GCX](https://github.com/DanyelleAngelo/GCX/tree/main)** and **[GC*](https://github.com/DanyelleAngelo/GCX/tree/main)** compression algorithm by comparing it against GCIS and RePair algorithms. The tests measure:

- Compression performance (time and ratio);
- Decompression performance (time);
- Substring extraction time;
- Memory usage across all operations; and
- Grammar analysis for GCX and GC* .

## ⚙️ Dependencies

This benchmark uses the following external tools:
- [GCX](https://github.com/DanyelleAngelo/GCX/tree/main) - Our target compression algorithm
- [GCIS](https://github.com/danielsaad/GCIS#) - Grammar compression reference
- [RePair]() - Classical compression algorithm
- [ShapeSlp](https://github.com/itomomoti/ShapedSlp/tree/master) - Required to perform extraction of grammar generated by RePair
- [malloc-count](https://github.com/bingmann/malloc_count) - Required to account for memory usage
- [sdls](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) - Required for reference algorithms

## Usage
```shell
./measure_compression.sh
```
